## What is correlation?
Correlation, roughly defined, is the degree to which two variables are related. Below are several examples of correlation. The larger the r value the more correlated the data, for example -0.0 (a small or “low” correlation) to -1 (a large or “high” correlation).


In the main task, you will be shown several pairs of charts and asked to choose which visualization appears more correlated.

## Examples
As an example of a negative correlation, imagine the cost of eggs, and the number of eggs sold in a supermarket: the more expensive the eggs are, the fewer are being sold.

As an example of negative correlation, imagine measuring the amount of time watching TV in hours, and physical fitness scores. As the amount of time watching TV increases, physical fitness scores tend to decrease.
