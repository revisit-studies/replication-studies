#### PRESENTATION OF THE PROJECT (OR EXPERIMENTATION)

##### IDENTIFICATION

Project name: Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization

You are invited to take part in this project of which the purpose is to explore how to use texture in visual data representations. The Aviz team is an expert in the field of visualization and the results of these experiments will help us to improve visualization design and research in this field more generally. This study will take place online.

The expected benefits of the project are the following: Low-color visualization is a concise, accurate, and powerful way of visualizing data that has broad application potential. Black-and-white representations can lead to more accessible visualizations and avoid unwanted color association. In addition, visualizations with very few colors can be used in new environments such as knitting, embroidery, or 3D printing. Texture is an effective channel to replace color in low-color visualization. However, texture has a lot of parameters and there is currently a lack of research on how to combine these parameters to make texture suitable for visualization. Our project will help us understand how we can best display information and data aesthetically and effectively with texture, and help push the development of low-color visualization further.

This project has received a favorable opinion from Inria's Operational Committee for the Assessment of legal and ethical risks.

#### YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT

##### Conditions of your participation:

###### Participation Requirements

Participants must be fluent English speakers, of legal age (18 years in most countries), and consider himself/herself experienced on the topic of visualization and in design.

If you agree to participate, we will save some experiment parameters in the local storage in your browser.

###### Procedure

We first ask participants for their informed consent and background information. After being walked through a tutorial and getting familiar with our design tool, participants will design two charts each, using one of two texture types with our design tool. Then we will ask participants about their design strategies, their opinion on using these two types of textures. We will also apply the texture they design for the assigned chart type to another two chart types and ask for their opinions about how their design transfers to other chart types.

The whole experiment will take around 25 minutes. After the participants finish the experiment, we allow participants to do more trials if they wish. If they decide to do more, the duration time will add approximately 15 minutes for each additional trial.
We will not take photographs or videos.

###### Benefits

This research will contribute to research in low-color visualization design.

###### Risks and drawbacks

There are no known risks or drawbacks associated with this research study.

##### Voluntary participation in the project

Once you have read and understood the information contained in the "Project Presentation" section, your signature on this form indicates that you agree to participate in the project, and this without any restrictions or external pressure.
If you don't have the information that you need to make a decision, you should not hesitate to ask for more information from the contact persons (see below).

##### Withdrawal from the project at any time

You are completely free to end your participation in the project at any time. All you have to do is let the contact persons know (below). You don't have to provide any reasons for your withdrawal.

##### Following your withdrawal from the project

Regarding the data concerning you which may have been collected before you withdraw from the project, the research team may continue to use such data for the time during which the data mentioned below is kept.

As we do not collect data allowing us to identify you, requests to exercise rights could not take place.

For any question about the processing of your data in this system, you can contact the DPO:

* Contact our DPO electronically: dpo@inria.fr
* Contact our DPO by post: The Data Protection Officer Inria, 2004 route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex

##### Request for information during the project

If you have any additional questions about the project or about your rights as a participant in this research, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the contact persons mentioned below.

##### Information concerning the principal results of the research

If you would like a written summary about the principal results of this research and their use, please ask the contact persons.

This form for requesting information and for collecting informed consent is a confidential and sensitive document, and as such it must be given special treatment both in the way that it is kept and archived.

With your participation, you also agree that we will save your final design parameters and potentially use your design in a future publication or study, and we also will upload the collected anonymous data to a public platform, such as OSF, to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

You also certify that you agree your data (range age and self-declared gender) be processed by Inria for the purpose of carrying out the study.
