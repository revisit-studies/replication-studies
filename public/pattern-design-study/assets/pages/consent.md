Title of Research Study: Designing black-and-white patterns for visualizations 

 

## Introduction 

You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation. This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation. 

 

## Purpose of the Study 

Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn more about to better design black-and-white patterns for visualizations. 

 

Tasks 

We first ask participants for their informed consent and background information. After being walked through a tutorial and getting familiar with our design tool, participants will design two charts each, using one of two texture types with our design tool. Then we will ask participants about their design strategies, their opinion on using these two types of patterns. We will also apply the patterns they design for the assigned chart type to another two chart types and ask for their opinions about how their design transfers to other chart types. The experiment should take around 25 minutes to complete. 

 

## Risks to study participants 

Participation in this study involves minimal risks. However, there is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality, as is common in most research studies.  

Participants may encounter unexpected risks during the experience (boredom, difficulty, etc.). If at any point you feel uncomfortable or wish to stop participating, you can withdraw from the study without penalty. 

## Benefits to research participants and others 

The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data visualization, along with helping inform the development of future visualization design techniques. 

 

## Record keeping and confidentiality 

Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain circumstances, the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (U of U IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you. 

 

Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analysis. As such, your participation will remain anonymous, and your responses will not be used to identify you. 

 

## Cost/Payment 

Participants will receive no compensation for their participation.
