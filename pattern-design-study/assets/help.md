## Description

Patterns can be used to represent categories of data in charts or maps. There are different types of patterns we want to explore:

**Geometric patterns** are patterns made up of points and lines. They have been used for centuries in print. Here are some examples:

**Iconic patterns** resemble the data they stand for. Here are some examples of patterns for vegetables:

In this experiment, you will design visualization once with geometric patterns and once with iconic patterns. We would like to ask you to parameterize the patterns appropriately for an effective visualization with our pattern design tool.

Before the experiment, let's first go through a tutorial to get familiar with the interface and interaction of the pattern design tool.
