## What is correlation?
Correlation, roughly defined, is the degree to which two variables are related.
Below are several examples of correlation. The larger the r value -0.0 (small) to -1 (large) the more correlated the data. 

In this task, you will be shown several pairs of charts and asked to choose which visualization appears ***more correlated***.

Please review the examples below, and hit next at the bottom when you're ready for a practice section.

(If you are familiar with correlation already, note that we treat negative and positive correlation the same.)
